    engine, which led to my discovery of the graph database, Neo4j. The first 
    algorithm created links between users that followed the same subreddit. On the 
    next iteration, I optimized the query to prioritize uncommon subreddits and users 
    that previously "liked" another user. I built the frontend with React and cached 
    user data in Redux. To optimize the system architecture for scalability, I broke 
    out a microservice to store user data in a PostgreSQL database.`,
