They can slice and dice the data by time, type of parker, peak vs. average, etc. We used the amCharts library for the visualization and layered many features on top, such as last year comparison, adding annotations, downloading the chart and data, and an in-house legend with customizable colors."

      alt="reddit dating app signup flow"
      description={`I built this dating app to match users based on common subreddit interests. Users sign up with a Reddit account and feed our database with their stats and trends from Reddit. It was my first time creating a recommendation engine, which led to my discovery of the graph database, Neo4j. The first algorithm created links between users that followed the same subreddit. On the next iteration, I optimized the query to prioritize uncommon subreddits and users that previously "liked" another user. I built the frontend with React and cached user data in Redux. To optimize the system architecture for scalability, I broke out a microservice to store user data in a PostgreSQL database.`}

In Hoarders, the goal is to collect coins around the city by getting within physical range and banking them at your home base. I used the browser's geolocation API to track and update player coordinates. I also enabled multiplayer functionality by streaming player locations with Socket.io.`}

On EatUp, users can create new "EatUp" events by selecting a restaurant from the Google Places API and posting it to the site. When a user wants to join an EatUp, the results displayed on the dashboard are filtered based on the user's location. I used React to build the frontend components, Node and Express for the backend, and MySQL to store all the user data and content.`}
