    can analyze their occupancy, revenue, and duration data. They can slice
    and dice the data by time, type of parker, peak vs. average, etc. We
    used the amCharts library for the visualization and layered many

    interests. Users sign up with a Reddit account and feed our database with their 
    stats and trends from Reddit. It was my first time creating a recommendation 
    engine, which led to my discovery of the graph database, Neo4j. The first 
    algorithm created links between users that followed the same subreddit. On the 
    next iteration, I optimized the query to prioritize uncommon subreddits and users 
    that previously "liked" another user. I built the frontend with React and cached 
    user data in Redux. To optimize the system architecture for scalability, I broke 
    out a microservice to store user data in a PostgreSQL database.`,

    getting within physical range and banking them at your home base. I used the browser's 
    geolocation API to track and update player coordinates. I also enabled multiplayer 
    functionality by streaming player locations with Socket.io.`,

    Google Places API and posting it to the site. When a user wants to join an EatUp, the 
    results displayed on the dashboard are filtered based on the user's location. I used 
    React to build the frontend components, Node and Express for the backend, and MySQL to
